# 3. The Kink: A Flexible Threshold

To keep supply and demand in harmony, Comet uses a concept called the “kink.” It’s basically a utilization threshold at which interest rates start to rise faster. The model consists of two linear slopes:

1. Below the Kink

• Rates increase at a moderate pace as utilization climbs.

• The idea is to gradually incentivize more deposits and discourage excessive borrowing.

2. Beyond the Kink

• Rates become steeper if utilization passes the kink.

• This rapid increase makes borrowing more expensive, protecting the market from hitting extremely high utilization levels that could push lenders away.

Think of the kink as the “comfort zone” threshold. Once that line is crossed, the protocol reacts more aggressively to prevent the market from running out of liquidity.
