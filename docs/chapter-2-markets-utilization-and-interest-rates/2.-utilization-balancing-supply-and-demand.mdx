# 2. Utilization: Balancing Supply & Demand

“Utilization” tells us how much of the supplied base asset is currently being borrowed out of the total available. Think of it like this:

• 0% utilization means that no one is borrowing from the pool.

• 100% utilization means everything supplied is currently borrowed, leaving no extra liquidity.

A higher utilization typically means that demand for borrowing is strong, which pushes interest rates upward to encourage more deposits (and possibly curb borrowing). Conversely, low utilization means there’s plenty of liquidity left in the pool, so borrowing becomes less expensive.
