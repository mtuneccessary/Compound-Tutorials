# 1. What Is a Market in Comet?

In Compound V3 (Comet), each “market” revolves around a single base asset—this could be USDC, ETH, stETH, USDS, or another token chosen for that instance. Whether you’re lending or borrowing, it all ties back to this single asset.\
\
• For example, in a USDC-based Comet, users deposit various collaterals (e.g., WETH, LINK) but only borrow USDC.

• In an ETH-based Comet, you can deposit select collateral tokens to borrow ETH. This keeps lending and borrowing simpler while giving  a clear view of how much liquidity is in a single market.
