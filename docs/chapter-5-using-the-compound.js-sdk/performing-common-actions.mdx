## Performing Common Actions

**Supplying Assets**

Supply assets to earn interest or repay loans:

```javascript
await comet.supply(Compound.USDC, 1000);
console.log("Supplied USDC to the protocol.");
```

**Borrowing Assets**

Borrowing is as simple as calling the withdraw function:

```javascript
await comet.withdraw(Compound.USDC, 500);
console.log("Borrowed 500 USDC.");
```

**Checking Balances**

Fetch your current balance of any asset:

```javascript
const balance = await comet.getAccountBalance(Compound.USDC);
console.log(`Your USDC balance is: ${balance}`);
```

**Fetching Market Data**

Retrieve live market data:

```javascript
const markets = await comet.getMarkets();
console.log(markets);
```

This integration provides real-time insights into asset performance and protocol metrics, empowering developers to build sophisticated tools.
