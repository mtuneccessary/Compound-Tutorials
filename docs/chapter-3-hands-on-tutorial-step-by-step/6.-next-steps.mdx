# 6. Next Steps

• If you want to repay your borrowed USDC, just approve and supply USDC back to the contract (similar to how you supplied WETH).

• If your debt is zero (or low), you can withdraw your WETH by calling `comet.withdraw(wethAddress, amount)`

• You can experiment with partial vs. full repayment and see how your borrow balance updates accordingly.

This tutorial should help you understand how to programmatically interact with a USDC-based Comet on Sepolia. As you grow more comfortable, feel free to adapt the code for mainnet or other networks—just ensure you update the addresses, ABIs, and environment variables accordingly.
