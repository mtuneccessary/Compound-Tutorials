# 2. Getting Sepolia ETH and WETH

Every transaction on Ethereum (including Sepolia testnet) requires ETH to pay for gas fees and so is compound operations requires collateral. To get some test ETH:

• Head to a known Sepolia faucet, like:

– https://sepoliafaucet.com

– [https://faucet.sepolia.dev](https://token-faucet.defillama.com/) (WETH)

Simply enter your wallet address and request test ETH or WETH. Once completed, confirm your wallet received the funds by viewing it on a Sepolia block explorer or in MetaMask.
