# 1. What Is Compound?

Compound is a decentralized lending protocol that operates on various blockchain networks, primarily Ethereum. At its heart, Compound turns the lending and borrowing of cryptocurrencies into a streamlined, trustless process—no banks or gatekeepers required. If you have spare crypto assets, you can supply (lend) them through Compound to earn interest. If you need liquidity, you can borrow certain tokens by posting collateral, all while keeping ownership (and potential upside) of your collateralized assets.

#### A Brief History

Since its inception, Compound has focused on making digital asset lending safer and more accessible. Earlier versions allowed multiple assets to be borrowed from the same market, introducing complexity in risk management. Compound V3—codenamed “Comet”—simplifies this system.
