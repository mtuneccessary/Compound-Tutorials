# 2. Introducing Comet (Compound V3)

Comet is the latest version of the Compound protocol, designed to reduce complexity and enhance both user and developer experiences. Instead of juggling several borrowable assets, each Comet deployment only features one “base asset.” This can be any token that governance approves, including stablecoins like USDC, USDS, or USDT, as well as ETH or stETH, depending on the market you interact with.

#### Why a Single Base Asset?

• Easier to Understand: New users only have to learn about one main asset instead of multiple.

• Efficient Risk Management: Governance can tailor interest rates and collateral settings to match the specific risks of that single base asset.

• Streamlined Developer Onboarding: You can quickly get up to speed on how borrowing and lending works without juggling multiple markets.
