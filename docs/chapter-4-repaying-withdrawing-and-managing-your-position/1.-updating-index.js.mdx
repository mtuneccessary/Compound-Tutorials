# 1. Updating index.js

In Chapter 3, you created a JavaScript project with an index.js file that:&#x20;

• Connected to Sepolia with a provider and signer.&#x20;

• Used contract instances of Comet, WETH, and USDC.

&#x20;• Showed how to supply WETH as collateral and borrow USDC.&#x20;

In this chapter, we’ll extend that same index.js with new functions for repaying what you borrowed and withdrawing your collateral.



Let’s assume your index.js from Chapter 3 has code similar to this structure:

• Environment variable load (dotenv)• Ethers provider and signer setup

• Contract addresses & ABIs (comet, weth, usdc)

• Functions for:

– supplyWethAsCollateral(amount)

– borrowUsdc(amount)

• A main execution block with `(async () => { /* ... */ })()`

Now, we’ll show you how to integrate new repayment and withdraw collage.&#x20;

Just place the following code chunks below the existing supply/borrow functions (but above your main execution block or in a dedicated helper module if you prefer)



#### 1.1 Adding a Function to Check Debt

First, we add a getUsdcDebt function. This will help you see how much you currently owe in USDC (the base asset).

```javascript
async function getUsdcDebt() {
  const debtRaw = await comet.borrowBalanceOf(signer.address);
  console.log("Current USDC debt (raw units):", debtRaw.toString());
  return debtRaw;
}
```

Explanation:&#x20;

• If USDC has 6 decimals, and this function returns 50,000,000, that would be 50 USDC in standard decimal format.



#### 1.2 Approving USDC for Repayment

Just like you approved WETH for supplying, you need to approve Comet to handle your USDC when repaying.



```javascript
async function approveUsdcForRepayment(amount) {
  console.log(`Approving ${amount.toString()} USDC for repayment...`);
  const tx = await usdc.approve(cometAddress, amount);
  await tx.wait();
  console.log("USDC approved successfully for repayment.");
}
```

Explanation:&#x20;

• The user is allowing the Comet contract to pull USDC from their account to cover the repayment.



#### 1.3 Repaying Your Borrowed USDC

Once approved, you can repay USDC by “supplying” it back to Comet. This reduces (or eliminates) your debt.

```javascript
async function repayUsdc(amount) {
  console.log(`Repaying ${amount.toString()} USDC...`);
  const tx = await comet.supply(usdcAddress, amount);
  await tx.wait();
  console.log("USDC repaid successfully.");
}
```

Explanation:&#x20;

• The supply(...) function works for any token, including the base asset.&#x20;

• Because you have a negative balance (i.e., a debt) in USDC, supplying USDC reduces that negative balance.



#### 1.4 Withdrawing Collateral (WETH)

After you repay what you owe (or if you simply haven’t borrowed much), you can remove some or all of your WETH collateral:

```javascript
async function withdrawWeth(amount) {
  console.log(`Withdrawing ${amount.toString()} WETH...`);
  const tx = await comet.withdraw(wethAddress, amount);
  await tx.wait();
  console.log("WETH withdrawn successfully.");
}
```

If you still have a debt, make sure you don’t drop below the required collateral threshold. Otherwise, the transaction may revert.
