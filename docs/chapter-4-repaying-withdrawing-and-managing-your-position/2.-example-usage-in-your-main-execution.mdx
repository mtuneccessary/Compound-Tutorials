# 2. Example Usage in Your Main Execution

At the bottom of your index.js, you can now integrate these new functions. For instance:

```javascript
(async () => {
  try {
    // 1. Check current debt
    const debtRaw = await getUsdcDebt();
    const usdcDecimals = await usdc.decimals();
    console.log(`Debt in raw units: ${debtRaw.toString()}`);
    console.log(`Debt in USDC: ${ethers.utils.formatUnits(debtRaw, usdcDecimals)}`);

    // 2. Partially repay some USDC (example: half your debt)
    const halfDebt = debtRaw.div(2);
    // Approve & repay
    await approveUsdcForRepayment(halfDebt);
    await repayUsdc(halfDebt);

    // 3. Check updated debt
    const newDebtRaw = await getUsdcDebt();
    console.log(`New debt in USDC: ${ethers.utils.formatUnits(newDebtRaw, usdcDecimals)}`);

    // 4. Fully repay the remaining debt
    await approveUsdcForRepayment(newDebtRaw);
    await repayUsdc(newDebtRaw);

    // 5. Confirm your debt is now zero
    const finalDebtRaw = await getUsdcDebt();
    console.log(`Final debt: ${ethers.utils.formatUnits(finalDebtRaw, usdcDecimals)} (should be 0)`);

    // 6. (Optional) Withdraw all or some WETH if you have no debt or enough collateral
    const withdrawAmount = ethers.utils.parseUnits("0.1", await weth.decimals());
    await withdrawWeth(withdrawAmount);

    console.log("Repayment and withdrawal steps completed!");
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error in repayment/withdrawal flow:", err);
  }
})();
```

Explanation:

* getUsdcDebt() shows how much you owe.
* We repay half of it first, just to illustrate partial repayment.
* We check the updated debt, then repay the rest.
* After full repayment, your USDC debt should be 0.
* Finally, you withdraw some of your WETH collateral (if you no longer need it locked in Comet).
